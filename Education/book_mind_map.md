Create a mind map that visually organizes the key points from this book. The mind map should cover the major themes and concepts discussed in the book. Break each of these broad themes into subtopics. Provide a clear structure with hierarchical nodes for each main topic and its subpoints.



Use Markmap.js code (example below) in a code block to represent the mind map, with branches for each of the main topics and subtopics, without mentionning the cites. The mind map should be easy to navigate and visually clear, allowing the reader to understand the interconnectedness of the key ideas.
