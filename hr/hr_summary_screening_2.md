### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE ###

#### QUESTION 1: "TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES."
**Transcript**: "I’ve worked with AWS for about 5 years, primarily focusing on architecture design and implementing solutions with services like EC2, S3, and RDS. For example, I designed a scalable system for an e-commerce platform that reduced latency by 30% using AWS Lambda. I’m also familiar with Azure, but I haven’t worked with GCP yet."
**Summary**: The candidate has 5 years of hands-on experience with AWS, with strong expertise in architecture design and implementing scalable solutions. They successfully reduced latency by 30% for an e-commerce platform using AWS Lambda. Limited exposure to GCP was noted.

#### QUESTION 2: "HOW DO YOU APPROACH DEBUGGING COMPLEX CODE ISSUES?"
**Transcript**: "I first reproduce the issue in a controlled environment, then analyze logs and stack traces. For example, I recently debugged a memory leak in a Python application by isolating a third-party library causing the issue."
**Summary**: The candidate follows a systematic approach to debugging, starting with issue reproduction and log analysis. They demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by identifying a memory leak in a Python application.
